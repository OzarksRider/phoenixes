The phoenix is bird from Greek mythology that would live a very long time, but eventually die by bursting into flames. From the ashes, a new bird would be born to start the 500 year cycle anew. ![Phoenix](images/Greek_Phoenix.svg)

In the early days of the internet, if your website needed surge or backup capacity you needed to purchase and maintatin those extra servers. This required a lot of extra expense. These extra physical servers required full time space and maintainence in datacenters and by staff for part-time use. For example, if you ran an e-commerce site like Amazon, you would experience a huge surge in traffic around Christmas. If you did not have these servers available, customers could not purchase from you. Even worse, they might find another online retailer whose infrastructure was able to provide them with service. A lot of effort and expense goes into finding new customers and building brand loyalty. 

Advances in computing and CPU capabilities provided a solution with the ability to virtualize machines. New CPU instructions were added that allowed a single physical machine to run multiple isolated virtual machines in a way that kept the secrets on the machine safe.
